The Anesthesia Interest Group integrates cutting-edge Virtual Reality (VR) technology to enhance medical education and procedural training. Our VR simulations provide an immersive, hands-on experience that helps students develop critical skills in a controlled, high-fidelity environment.

What We Offer

- Procedural Training: Our VR modules allow students to practice essential procedures such as central line placement, chest tube insertion, and tracheostomy replacement. These skills are crucial for anesthesia and critical care but can be difficult to access in traditional training settings.

- Ultrasound Lab: We provide 3D visualizations that track the movement of the ultrasound probe in real-time, helping students understand probe positioning and interpretation. Our lab also includes a variety of pathological vs. normal findings to improve diagnostic skills.

- Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) Training: TEE is a vital tool in anesthesia and cardiology. Our VR program introduces students to TEE probe manipulation, cardiac anatomy, and key pathologies that are best visualized through this technique.


By integrating VR into medical education, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice, giving students the confidence and hands-on experience they need to excel.
