About Us
Who We Are
The Wayne State Anesthesia Interest Group (AIG) is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering interest, knowledge, and career development in the field of anesthesiology. Our goal is to provide medical students with opportunities to explore anesthesia as a specialty through hands-on experiences, mentorship, and educational events.

Our Mission
We strive to:

Educate students about the role of anesthesiologists in perioperative medicine, critical care, and pain management.
Connect students with residents and attending anesthesiologists for mentorship and networking.
Provide hands-on learning experiences, including simulation labs, airway management workshops, and procedural skills training.
Support students in their journey toward a career in anesthesiology by offering guidance on research opportunities, residency applications, and career planning.
Our History
The Wayne State AIG has long been an integral part of the medical student community, helping to bridge the gap between preclinical education and clinical exposure to anesthesiology. Through partnerships with the Department of Anesthesiology, hospital affiliates, and national organizations like the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), our group has continuously provided valuable learning and networking opportunities for students interested in this dynamic specialty.

Get Involved
Whether you are considering a career in anesthesia or just want to learn more about the specialty, we welcome all students to join us! Attend our events, participate in workshops, and connect with like-minded peers and mentors.
